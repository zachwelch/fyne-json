# fyne-json

This package provides a simple JSON viewer, using the
[Fyne](https://fyne.io) GUI toolkit.  A separate module provides simple
parsing, tree walking, and serialization functions; that core module is
also used by the included CLI: `jd`.

The initial version was written to experiment with Fyne, and it probably
contains plenty of bugs when it comes to various corner cases.  However,
it loads all of the files that I could find in my home directory, so I
thought that I should publish it before I managed to forget about it.
